**IPEM ESP32 ATM90E32 ATM90E36 IoT Power Energy Monitor**

------------

This folder contains IPEM Example Source Code.

  Remember!
  - Set the BOARD to ESP32, 'WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32' DEV Module (or similar).
  - You may set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
  - The SDK does NOT need external power to flash.  It will take Power from the USB 5V.
  
  Note: In the default state, upon first power up and during reset, the Green LED may be partially lit. Once programmed and the GPIO defined, the Green LED will go off after power up.

  This test code is OPEN SOURCE and formatted for easier viewing.  Although is is not intended for real world use, it may be freely used, or modified as needed.
