For various production reasons and component availability, our boards may require update.  The below list contains any revision information summary.

  IPEM-1 ESP32 ATM90E32 ATM90E36 IoT Power Energy Monitoring Energy Monitor Board SDK
  Features include ESP32 IPEM ESP32 ATM90E32 ATM90E36 16bit ADC EEPROM 3Phase 3+N 3+1 CT-Clamps Current Voltage Frequency 

*Production*
1.2304-203	Exactly the same as 1.2303-202 but has BOM specific updates for the ESP32E ATM90E32 AP63203 Variant for production.
1.2303-202	Final Production Release, same as 1.2302-201 but has reverted back to a CH340C and has an additional GP0/GP26 Link.

*Pre-Production*
1.2303-201	Pre-Production Release, same as 1.2302-201 but has schematic text changes so both variants option CT4 with ESP32 ADC
1.2302-201	Pre-Production Release.  Last minuted change from CH340C to CH340E due to supply issues.
1.2302-101	Beta Release
